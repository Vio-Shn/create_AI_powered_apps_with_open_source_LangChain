### What I learn from this Project :
LangChain is a versatile Python library that simplifies building applications with Large Language Models (LLM).
- Create a simple Chatbot-->send requests to the OpenAI API using the LangChain library. The request is to generate a response to a question.
- Creating a Cover Letter Bot-->using LangChain's quick templates, to develop an application that takes specific input such as position, company, and skills, ultimately generating a cover letter.
- Chatbot Support Chatbot-->uses LangChain which takes user input, formats the prompt with it, and then sends it to LLM.
- Friend's Chatbot-->LangChain provides various types of memory that can be used to track conversations.
- Python Code Writing Bot-->provides functionality for various tasks. For example, with tools, LangChain agents can search the web, do math, run code
